# Bonsai Python SDK

The Bonsai SDK is a framework and set of tools for interacting with the Bonsai platform. It is used both as a platform for internally developed simulator platform plugins and externally developed simulators.

This repository includes the python library (`bonsai-ai`) and the supporting Bridge for Bonsai's OpenAI Gym (bonsai-gym). It also contains samples and offline documentation for connecting to the Bonsai Platform.

## Documentation
Full documentation for Bonsai's Platform can be found at [https://docs.bons.ai](). The `bonsai-ai` documentation specifically can be found in [Bonsai's Python Library Reference](https://docs.bons.ai/references/library-reference.html).

You can also use Pydoc for standard Python documentation built into this library.
